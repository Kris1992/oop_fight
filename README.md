# OOP_FIGHT  

Small application written in PHP (Symfony 5). This is small game almost everything is random generated. This project was created to show my skills in object oriented PHP. When creating this project I used few design patterns.

# Setup

Thanks to download the code. 

To get it working, follow these steps:

**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

**Configure the .env (or .env.local) File**

Open file `.env` and make changes you need - specifically in `DATABASE_URL`.

**Setup the Database**

If you end previous step, it's time to create tables in database by commands below:

```
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

**Start the built-in web server**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but Symfony's local web server
works even better.

To install the Symfony local web server, follow
"Downloading the Symfony client" instructions found
here: https://symfony.com/download - you only need to do this
once on your system.

Then, to start the web server, open a terminal, move into the
project, and run:

```
symfony serve
```

Now check out the site at `http://localhost:8000`

Have fun!
